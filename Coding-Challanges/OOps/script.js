////////////////Coding Challenge #1

Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a 
'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in 
km/h

2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, 
and log the new speed to the console

3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log 
the new speed to the console

4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 
'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
ยง Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

const mercedes = new Car('Mercedes', 95);

Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 10;

};

Car.prototype.brake = function () {

bmw.accelerate();
bmw.brake();

mercedes.accelerate();
mercedes.brake();

/*
Coding Challenge #2

Your tasks:

1. Re-create Challenge #1, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')

2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide 
by 1.6)

3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but 
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)

4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h

/*
Coding Challenge #3

Your tasks:
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called 'EV') as a child
"class" of 'Car'. Besides a make and current speed, the 'EV' also has the 
current battery charge in % ('charge' property)

2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 
'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo'

3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, 
and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 
km/h, with a charge of 22%'


Test data:
 Data car 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%
*/

// console.log('\n\n---Coding challange -3');

// const EV = function (make, speed, charge) {
//   Car.call(this, make, speed);
//   this.charge = charge;
// };

// //linking the prototype
// EV.prototype = Object.create(Car.prototype);

// EV.prototype.chargeBattery = function (chargeTo) {
//   this.charge = chargeTo;
// };

// EV.prototype.accelerate = function () {
//   this.speed += 20;
//   this.charge--;
//   console.log(
//     `Tesla is going at a speed of ${this.speed} km/h with a charge of ${this.charge} %`
//   );
// };

// const tesla = new EV('Tesla', 120, 23);
// // tesla.chargeBattery(90);
// console.log(tesla);
// tesla.accelerate();

// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private;
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!
